Here are their stories.</p><div class="sect2" title="Rob Gagnon's Story"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp21504320"></a>Rob Gagnon's Story</h3></div></div></div><p>"We use ØMQ to assist in aggregating thousands of events occurring every minute across our global network of telecommunications servers so that we can accurately report and monitor for situations that require our attention. ØMQ made the development of the system not only easier, but faster to develop and more robust and fault-tolerant than we had originally planned in our original design.</p><p>"We're able to easily add and remove clients from the network without the loss of any message. If we need to enhance the server portion of our system, we can stop and restart it as well without having to worry about stopping all of the clients first. The built-in buffering of ØMQ makes this all possible."</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Tom van Leeuwen's Story"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp21505664"></a>Tom van Leeuwen's Story</h3></div></div></div><p>"I was looking at creating some kind of service bus connecting all kinds of services together. There were already some products that implemented a broker, but they did not have the functionality I needed. By accident, I stumbled upon ØMQ, which is awesome. It's very lightweight, lean, simple and easy to follow because the guide is very complete and reads very well. I've actually implemented the Titanic pattern and the Majordomo broker with some additions (client/worker authentication and workers sending a catalog explaining what they provide and how they should be addressed).</p><p>"The beautiful thing about ØMQ is the fact that it is a library and not an application. You can mold it however you like and it simply puts boring things like queuing, reconnecting, TCP sockets and such to the background, making sure you can concentrate on what is important to you. I've implemented all kinds of workers/clients and the broker in Ruby, because that is the main language we use for development, but also some PHP clients to connect to the bus from existing PHP webapps. We use this service bus for cloud services, connecting all kinds of platform devices to a service bus exposing functionality for automation.</p><p>"ØMQ is very easy to understand and if you spend a day with the guide, you'll have good knowledge of how it works. I'm a network engineer, not a software developer, but managed to create a very nice solution for our automation needs! ØMQ: Thank you very much!"</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Michael Jakl's Story"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp21508576"></a>Michael Jakl's Story</h3></div></div></div><p>"We use ØMQ for distributing millions of documents per day in our distributed processing pipeline. We started out with big message queuing brokers that had their own respective issues and problems. In the quest of simplifying our architecture, we chose ØMQ to do the wiring. So far it had a huge impact in how our architecture scales and how easy it is to change and move the components. The plethora of language bindings lets us choose the right tool for the job without sacrificing interoperability in our system. We don't use a lot of sockets (less than 10 in our whole application), but that's all we needed to split a huge monolithic application into small independent parts.</p><p>"All in all, ØMQ lets me keep my sanity and helps my customers stay within budget."</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Vadim Shalts's Story"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp21510152"></a>Vadim Shalts's Story</h3></div></div></div><p>"I am team leader in the company ActForex, which develops software for financial markets. Due to the nature of our domain, we need to process large volumes of prices quickly. In addition, it's extremely critical to minimize latency in processing orders and prices. Achieving a high throughput is not enough. Everything must be handled in a soft real time with a predictable ultra low latency per price. The system consists of multiple components exchanging messages. Each price can take a lot of processing stages, each of which increases total latency. As a consequence, low and predictable latency of messaging between components becomes a key factor of our architecture.</p><p>"We investigated different solutions to find something suitable for our needs. We tried different message brokers (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ Apollo, Kafka), but failed to reach a low and predictable latency with any of them. In the end, we chose ZeroMQ used in conjunction with ZooKeeper for service discovery. Complex coordination with ZeroMQ requires a relatively large effort and a good understanding, as a result of the natural complexity of multithreading. We found that an external agent like ZooKeeper is better choice for service discovery and coordination while ZeroMQ can be used primarily for simple messaging. ZeroMQ fit perfectly into our architecture. It allowed us to achieve the desired latency using minimal efforts. It saved us from a bottleneck in the processing of messages and made processing time very stable and predictable.</p><p>"I can decidedly recommend ZeroMQ for solutions where low latency is important."</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch08s12.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch09s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Conclusions </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> How This Book Happened</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
