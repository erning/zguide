This really just means solving problems more cheaply. It sounds straight-forward, but the history of collapsed tech giants proves that it's not. I'll try to explain how teams so often get it wrong, and suggest a way for doing innovation right.</p><div class="sect2" title="The Tale of Two Bridges"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp20742752"></a>The Tale of Two Bridges</h3></div></div></div><p>Two old engineers were talking of their lives and boasting of their greatest projects. One of the engineers explained how he had designed one of the greatest bridges ever made.</p><p>"We built it across a river gorge," he told his friend. "It was wide and deep. We spent two years studying the land, and choosing designs and materials. We hired the best engineers and designed the bridge, which took another five years. We contracted the largest engineering firms to build the structures, the towers, the tollbooths, and the roads that would connect the bridge to the main highways. Dozens died during the construction. Under the road level we had trains, and a special path for cyclists. That bridge represented years of my life."</p><p>The second man reflected for a while, then spoke. "One evening me and a friend got drunk on vodka, and we threw a rope across a gorge," he said. "Just a rope, tied to two trees. There were two villages, one at each side. At first, people pulled packages across that rope with a pulley and string. Then someone threw a second rope, and built a foot walk. It was dangerous, but the kids loved it. A group of men then rebuilt that, made it solid, and women started to cross, everyday, with their produce. A market grew up on one side of the bridge, and slowly that became a large town, because there was a lot of space for houses. The rope bridge got replaced with a wooden bridge, to allow horses and carts to cross. Then the town built a real stone bridge, with metal beams. Later, they replaced the stone part with steel, and today there's a suspension bridge standing in that same spot."</p><p>The first engineer was silent. "Funny thing," he said, "my bridge was demolished about ten years after we built it. Turns out it was built in the wrong place and no one wanted to use it. Some guys had thrown a rope across the gorge, a few miles further downstream, and that's where everyone went."</p></div><div class="sect2" title="How ØMQ Lost Its Road Map"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp20745848"></a>How ØMQ Lost Its Road Map</h3></div></div></div><p>Presenting ØMQ at the Mix-IT conference in Lyon in early 2012, I was asked several times for the "road map". My answer was: there is no road map any longer. We had road maps, and we deleted them. Instead of a few experts trying to lay out the next steps, we were allowing this to happen organically. The audience didn't really like my answer. So un-French.</p><p>However, the history of ØMQ makes it quite clear why road maps were problematic. In the beginning, we had a small team making the library, with few contributors, and no documented road map. As ØMQ grew more popular and we switched to more contributors, users asked for road maps. So we collected our plans together and tried to organize them into releases. Here, we wrote, is what will come in the next release.</p><p>As we rolled out releases, we hit the problem that it's very easy to promise stuff, and rather harder to make it as planned. For one thing, much of the work was voluntary, and it's not clear how you force volunteers to commit to a road map. But also, priorities can shift dramatically over time. So we were making promises we could not keep, and the real deliveries didn't match the road maps.</p><p>The second problem was that by defining the road map, we in effect claimed territory, making it harder for others to participate. People do prefer to contribute to changes they believe were their idea. Writing down a list of things to do turns contribution into a chore rather than an opportunity.</p><p>Finally, we saw changes in ØMQ that were quite traumatic, and the road maps didn't help with this, despite a lot of discussion and effort to "do it right". Examples of this were incompatible changes in APIs and protocols. It was quite clear that we needed a different approach for defining the change process.</p><p>Software engineers don't like the notion that powerful, effective solutions can come into existence without an intelligent designer actively thinking things through. And yet no one in that room in Lyon would have questioned evolution. A strange irony, and one I wanted to explore further as it underpins the direction the ØMQ community has taken since the start of 2012.</p><p>In the dominant theory of innovation, brilliant individuals reflect on large problem sets and then carefully and precisely create a solution. Sometimes they will have "eureka" moments where they "get" brilliantly simple answers to whole large problem sets. The inventor, and the process of invention are rare, precious, and can command a monopoly. History is full of such heroic individuals. We owe them our modern world.</p><p>Looking more closely, however, and you will see that the facts don't match. History doesn't show lone inventors. It shows lucky people who steal or claim ownership of ideas that are being worked on by many. It shows brilliant people striking lucky once, and then spending decades on fruitless and pointless quests. The best known large-scale inventors like Thomas Edison were in fact just very good at systematic broad research done by large teams. It's like claiming that Steve Jobs invented every device made by Apple. It is a nice myth, good for marketing, but utterly useless as practical science.</p><p>Recent history, much better documented and less easy to manipulate, shows this well. The Internet is surely one of the most innovative and fast-moving areas of technology, and one of the best documented. It has no inventor. Instead, it has a massive economy of people who have carefully and progressively solved a long series of immediate problems, documented their answers, and made those available to all. The innovative nature of the Internet comes not from a small, select band of Einsteins. It comes from RFCs anyone can use and improve, made by hundreds and thousands of smart, but not uniquely smart, individuals. It comes from open source software anyone can use and improve. It comes from sharing, scale of community, and the continuous accretion of good solutions and disposal of bad ones.</p><p>Here thus is an alternative theory of innovation:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>There is an infinite problem/solution terrain.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>This terrain changes over time according to external conditions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We can only accurately perceive problems to which we are close.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We can rank the cost/benefit economics of problems using a market for solutions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>There is an optimal solution to any solvable problem.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We can approach this optimal solution heuristically, and mechanically.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Our intelligence can make this process faster, but does not replace it.</p></li></ol></div><p>There are a few corollaries to this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Individual creativity matters less than process.</em></span> Smarter people may work faster, but they may also work in the wrong direction. It's the collective vision of reality that keeps us honest and relevant.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>We don't need road maps if we have a good process.</em></span> Functionality will emerge and evolve over time as solutions compete for market share.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>We don't invent solutions so much as discover them.</em></span> All sympathies to the creative soul. It's just an information processing machine that likes to polish its own ego and collect karma.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Intelligence is a social effect, though it feels personal.</em></span> A person cut off from others eventually stops thinking. We can neither collect problems nor measure solutions without other people.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The size and diversity of the community is a key factor.</em></span> Larger, more diverse communities collect more relevant problems, and solve them more accurately, and do this faster, than a small expert group.</p></li></ul></div><p>So, when we trust the solitary experts, they make classic mistakes. They focus on ideas, not problems. They focus on the wrong problems. They make misjudgments about the value of solving problems. They don't use their own work.</p><p>Can we turn the above theory into a reusable process? In late 2011, I started documenting C4 and similar contracts, and using them both in ØMQ and in closed source projects. The underlying process is something I call "Simplicity Oriented Design", or SOD. This is a reproducible way of developing simple and elegant products. It organizes people into flexible supply chains that are able to navigate a problem landscape rapidly and cheaply. They do this by building, testing, and keeping or discarding minimal plausible solutions, called "patches". Living products consist of long series of patches, applied one atop the other.</p><p>SOD is relevant first because it's how we evolve ØMQ. It's also the basis for the design process we will use in Advanced Architecture using ØMQ<a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Advanced Architecture using ØMQ">Chapter 7, <em>Advanced Architecture using ØMQ</em></a> to develop larger-scale ØMQ applications. Of course, you can use any software architecture methodology with ØMQ.</p><p>To best understand how we ended up with SOD, let's look at the alternatives.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Trash-Oriented Design"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp20760592"></a>Trash-Oriented Design</h3></div></div></div><p>The most popular design process in large businesses seems to be <span class="emphasis"><em>Trash-Oriented Design</em></span>, or TOD. TOD feeds off the belief that all we need to make money are great ideas. It's tenacious nonsense, but a powerful crutch for people who lack imagination. The theory goes that ideas are rare, so the trick is to capture them. It's like non-musicians being awed by a guitar player, not realizing that great talent is so cheap it literally plays on the streets for coins.</p><p>The main output of TODs is expensive "ideation": concepts, design documents, and products that go straight into the trash can. It works as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The Creative People come up with long lists of "we could do X and Y". I've seen endlessly detailed lists of everything amazing a product could do. We've all been guilty of this. Once the creative work of idea generation has happened, it's just a matter of execution, of course.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>So the managers and their consultants pass their brilliant ideas to designers who create acres of preciously refined design documents. The designers take the tens of ideas the managers came up with, and turn them into hundreds of world-changing designs.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>These designs get given to engineers who scratch their heads and wonder who the heck came up with such nonsense. They start to argue back, but the designs come from up high, and really, it's not up to engineers to argue with creative people and expensive consultants.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>So the engineers creep back to their cubicles, humiliated and threatened into building the gigantic but oh-so-elegant junk heap. It is bone-breaking work because the designs take no account of practical costs. Minor whims might take weeks of work to build. As the project gets delayed, the managers bully the engineers into giving up their evenings and weekends.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Eventually, something resembling a working product makes it out of the door. It's creaky and fragile, complex and ugly. The designers curse the engineers for their incompetence and pay more consultants to put lipstick onto the pig, and slowly the product starts to look a little nicer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>By this time, the managers have started to try to sell the product and they find, shockingly, that no one wants it. Undaunted, they courageously build million-dollar web sites and ad campaigns to explain to the public why they absolutely need this product. They do deals with other businesses to force the product on the lazy, stupid, and ungrateful market.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>After twelve months of intense marketing, the product still isn't making profits. Worse, it suffers dramatic failures and gets branded in the press as a disaster. The company quietly shelves it, fires the consultants, buys a competing product from a small startup and rebrands that as its own Version 2. Hundreds of millions of dollars end up in the trash.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Meanwhile, another visionary manager somewhere in the organization drinks a little too much tequila with some marketing people and has a Brilliant Idea.</p></li></ul></div><p>Trash-Oriented Design would be a caricature if it wasn't so common. Something like 19 out of 20 market-ready products built by large firms are failures (yes, 87% of statistics are made up on the spot). The remaining 1 in 20 probably only succeeds because the competitors are so bad and the marketing is so aggressive.</p><p>The main lessons of TOD are quite straightforward but hard to swallow. They are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Ideas are cheap. No exceptions. There are no brilliant ideas. Anyone who tries to start a discussion with "oooh, we can do this too!" should be beaten down with all the passion one reserves for traveling evangelists. It is like sitting in a cafe at the foot of a mountain, drinking a hot chocolate and telling others, "Hey, I have a great idea, we can climb that mountain! And build a chalet on top! With two saunas! And a garden! Hey, and we can make it solar powered! Dude, that's awesome! What color should we paint it? Green! No, blue! OK, go and make it, I'll stay here and make spreadsheets and graphics!"</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The starting point for a good design process is to collect real problems that confront real people. The second step is to evaluate these problems with the basic question, "How much is it worth to solve this problem?" Having done that, we can collect that set of problems that are worth solving.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Good solutions to real problems will succeed as products. Their success will depend on how good and cheap the solution is, and how important the problem is (and sadly, how big the marketing budgets are). But their success will also depend on how much they demand in effort to use--in other words, how simple they are.</p></li></ul></div><p>Now, after slaying the dragon of utter irrelevance, we attack the demon of complexity.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Complexity-Oriented Design"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp20770080"></a>Complexity-Oriented Design</h3></div></div></div><p>Really good engineering teams and small firms can usually build decent products. But the vast majority of products still end up being too complex and less successful than they might be. This is because specialist teams, even the best, often stubbornly apply a process I call <span class="emphasis"><em>Complexity-Oriented Design</em></span>, or COD, which works as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Management correctly identifies some interesting and difficult problem with economic value. In doing so, they already leapfrog over any TOD team.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The team with enthusiasm starts to build prototypes and core layers. These work as designed and thus encouraged, the team go off into intense design and architecture discussions, coming up with elegant schemas that look beautiful and solid.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Management comes back and challenges the team with yet more difficult problems. We tend to equate cost with value, so the harder and more expensive to solve, the more the solution should be worth, in their minds.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The team, being engineers and thus loving to build stuff, build stuff. They build and build and build and end up with massive, perfectly-designed complexity.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The products go to market, and the market scratches its head and asks, "Seriously, is this the best you can do?" People do use the products, especially if they aren't spending their own money in climbing the learning curve.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Management gets positive feedback from its larger customers, who share the same idea that high cost (in training and use) means high value, and so continues to push the process.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Meanwhile somewhere across the world, a small team is solving the same problem using a better process, and a year later smashes the market to little pieces.</p></li></ul></div><p>COD is characterized by a team obsessively solving the wrong problems in a form of collective delusion. COD products tend to be large, ambitious, complex, and unpopular. Much open source software is the output of COD processes. It is insanely hard for engineers to <span class="emphasis"><em>stop</em></span> extending a design to cover more potential problems. They argue, "What if someone wants to do X?" but never ask themselves, "What is the real value of solving X?"</p><p>A good example of COD in practice is Bluetooth, a complex, over-designed set of protocols that users hate. It continues to exist only because in a massively-patented industry there are no real alternatives. Bluetooth is perfectly secure, which is close to pointless for a proximity protocol. At the same time, it lacks a standard API for developers, meaning it's really costly to use Bluetooth in applications.</p><p>On the #zeromq IRC channel, Wintre once wrote of how enraged he was many years ago when he "found that XMMS 2 had a working plugin system, but could not actually play music."</p><p>COD is a form of large-scale "rabbit-holing", in which designers and engineers cannot distance themselves from the technical details of their work. They add more and more features, utterly misreading the economics of their work.</p><p>The main lessons of COD are also simple, but hard for experts to swallow. They are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Making stuff that you don't immediately have a need for is pointless. Doesn't matter how talented or brilliant you are, if you just sit down and make stuff people are not actually asking for, you are most likely wasting your time.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Problems are not equal. Some are simple, and some are complex. Ironically, solving the simpler problems often has more value to more people than solving the really hard ones. So if you allow engineers to just work on random things, they'll mostly focus on the most interesting but least worthwhile things.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Engineers and designers love to make stuff and decoration, and this inevitably leads to complexity. It is crucial to have a "stop mechanism", a way to set short, hard deadlines that force people to make smaller, simpler answers to just the most crucial problems.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Simplicity Oriented Design"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp20778832"></a>Simplicity Oriented Design</h3></div></div></div><p>Finally, we come to the rare but precious <span class="emphasis"><em>Simplicity Oriented Design</em></span>, or SOD. This process starts with a realization: we do not know what we have to make until after we start making it. Coming up with ideas or large-scale designs isn't just wasteful, it's a direct hindrance to designing the truly accurate solutions. The really juicy problems are hidden like far valleys, and any activity except active scouting creates a fog that hides those distant valleys. You need to keep mobile, pack light, and move fast.</p><p>SOD works as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>We collect a set of interesting problems (by looking at how people use technology or other products) and we line these up from simple to complex, looking for and identifying patterns of use.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We take the simplest, most dramatic problem and we solve this with a minimal plausible solution, or "patch". Each patch solves exactly a genuine and agreed-upon problem in a brutally minimal fashion.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We apply one measure of quality to patches, namely "Can this be done any simpler while still solving the stated problem?" We can measure complexity in terms of concepts and models that the user has to learn or guess in order to use the patch. The fewer, the better. A perfect patch solves a problem with zero learning required by the user.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Our product development consists of a patch that solves the problem "we need a proof of concept" and then evolves in an unbroken line to a mature series of products, through hundreds or thousands of patches piled on top of each other.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We do not do <span class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span> that is not a patch. We enforce this rule with formal processes that demand that every activity or task is tied to a genuine and agreed-upon problem, explicitly enunciated and documented.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We build our projects into a supply chain where each project can provide problems to its "suppliers" and receive patches in return. The supply chain creates the "stop mechanism" because when people are impatiently waiting for an answer, we necessarily cut our work short.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Individuals are free to work on any projects, and provide patches at any place they feel it's worthwhile. No individuals "own" any project, except to enforce the formal processes. A single project can have many variations, each a collection of different, competing patches.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Projects export formal and documented interfaces so that upstream (client) projects are unaware of change happening in supplier projects. Thus multiple supplier projects can compete for client projects, in effect creating a free and competitive market.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We tie our supply chain to real users and external clients and we drive the whole process by rapid cycles so that a problem received from outside users can be analyzed, evaluated, and solved with a patch in a few hours.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At every moment from the very first patch, our product is shippable. This is essential, because a large proportion of patches will be wrong (10-30%) and only by giving the product to users can we know which patches have become problems that need solving.</p></li></ul></div><p>SOD is a <span class="emphasis"><em>hill-climbing algorithm</em></span>, a reliable way of finding optimal solutions to the most significant problems in an unknown landscape. You don't need to be a genius to use SOD successfully, you just need to be able to see the difference between the fog of activity and the progress towards new real problems.</p><p>People have pointed out that hill-climbing algorithms have known limitations. One gets stuck on local peaks, mainly. But this is nonetheless how life itself works: collecting tiny incremental improvements over long periods of time. There is no intelligent designer. We reduce the risk of local peaks by spreading out widely across the landscape, but it is somewhat moot. The limitations aren't optional, they are physical laws. The theory says, <span class="emphasis"><em>this is how innovation really works, so better embrace it and work with it than try to work on the basis of magical thinking</em></span>.</p><p>And in fact once you see all innovation as more or less successful hill-climbing, you realize why some teams and companies and products get stuck in a never-never land of diminishing prospects. They simply don't have the diversity and collective intelligence to find better hills to climb. When Nokia killed their open source projects, they cut their own throat.</p><p>A really good designer with a good team can use SOD to build world-class products, rapidly and accurately. To get the most out of SOD the designer has to use the product continuously, from day one, and develop his or her ability to smell out problems such as inconsistency, surprising behavior, and other forms of friction. We naturally overlook many annoyances, but a good designer picks these up and thinks about how to patch them. Design is about removing friction in the use of a product.</p><p>In an open source setting, we do this work in public. There's no "let's open the code" moment. Projects that do this are in my view missing the point of open source, which is to engage your users in your exploration, and to build community around the seed of the architecture.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch06s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch06s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Git Branches Considered Harmful </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Burnout</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
