what's so special about ØMQ. My standard answer is that ØMQ is arguably the best answer we have to the vexing question of "How do we make the distributed software that the 21st century demands?" But more than that, ØMQ is special because of its community. This is ultimately what separates the wolves from the sheep.</p><p>There are three main open source patterns. The first is the large firm dumping code to break the market for others. This is the Apache Foundation model. The second is tiny teams or small firms building their dream. This is the most common open source model, which can be very successful commercially. The last is aggressive and diverse communities that swarm over a problem landscape. This is the Linux model, and the one to which we aspire with ØMQ.</p><p>It's hard to overemphasize the power and persistence of a working open source community. There really does not seem to be a better way of making software for the long term. Not only does the community choose the best problems to solve, it solves them minimally, carefully, and it then looks after these answers for years, decades, until they're no longer relevant, and then it quietly puts them away.</p><p>To really benefit from ØMQ, you need to understand the community. At some point down the road you'll want to submit a patch, an issue, or an add-on. You might want to ask someone for help. You will probably want to bet a part of your business on ØMQ, and when I tell you that the community is much, much more important than the company that backs the product, even though I'm CEO of that company, this should be significant.</p><p>In this chapter I'm going to look at our community from several angles and conclude by explaining in detail our contract for collaboration, which <a class="ulink" href="http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22" target="_top">we call "C4"</a>. You should find the discussion useful for your own work. We've also adapted the ØMQ C4 process for closed source projects with good success.</p><p>We'll cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The rough structure of ØMQ as a set of projects</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What "software architecture" is really about</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Why we use the LGPL and not the BSD license</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How we designed and grew the ØMQ community</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The business that backs ØMQ</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Who owns the ØMQ source code</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How to make and submit a patch to ØMQ</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Who controls what patches actually go into ØMQ</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How we guarantee compatibility with old code</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Why we don't use public git branches</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Who decides on the ØMQ road map</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A worked example of a change to <code class="literal">libzmq</code></p></li></ul></div><div class="sect1" title="Architecture of the ØMQ Community"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idp20536384"></a>Architecture of the ØMQ Community</h2></div></div></div><p>You know that ØMQ is an LGPL-licensed project. In fact it's a collection of projects, built around the core library, <code class="literal">libzmq</code>. I'll visualize these projects as an expanding galaxy:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>At the core, <code class="literal">libzmq</code> is the ØMQ core library. It's written in C++, with a low-level C API. The code is nasty, mainly because it's highly optimized but also because it's written in C++, a language that lends itself to subtle and deep nastiness. Martin Sustrik wrote the bulk of this code. Today it has dozens of people who maintain different parts of it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Around <code class="literal">libzmq</code>, there are about 50 <span class="emphasis"><em>bindings</em></span>. These are individual projects that create higher-level APIs for ØMQ, or at least map the low-level API into other languages. The bindings vary in quality from experimental to utterly awesome. Probably the most impressive binding is <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq" target="_top">PyZMQ</a>, which was one of the first community projects on top of ØMQ. If you are a binding author, you should really study PyZMQ and aspire to making your code and community as great.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A lot of languages have multiple bindings (Erlang, Ruby, C#, at least) written by different people over time, or taking varying approaches. We don't regulate these in any way. There are no "official" bindings. You vote by using one or the other, contributing to it, or ignoring it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>There are a series of reimplementations of <code class="literal">libzmq</code>, starting with JeroMQ, a full Java translation of the library, which is now the basis for NetMQ, a C# stack. These native stacks offer similar or identical APIs, and speak the same protocol (ZMTP) as <code class="literal">libzmq</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>On top of the bindings are a lot of projects that use ØMQ or build on it. See the "Labs" page on the wiki for a long list of projects and proto-projects that use ØMQ in some way. There are frameworks, web servers like Mongrel2, brokers like Majordomo, and enterprise open source tools like Storm.</p></li></ul></div><p><code class="literal">Libzmq</code>, most of the bindings, and some of the outer projects sit in the <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/organizations/zeromq" target="_top">ØMQ community "organization"</a> on GitHub. This organization is "run" by a group consisting of the most senior binding authors. There's very little to run as it's almost all self-managing and there's zero conflict these days.</p><p>iMatix, my firm, plays a specific role in the community. We own the trademarks and enforce them discretely in order to make sure that if you download a package calling itself "ZeroMQ", you can trust what you are getting. People have on rare occasion tried to hijack the name, maybe believing that "free software" means there is no property at stake and no one willing to defend it. One thing you'll understand from this chapter is how seriously we take the process behind our software (and I mean "us" as a community, not a company). iMatix backs the community by enforcing that process on anything calling itself "ZeroMQ" or "ØMQ". We also put money and time into the software and packaging for reasons I'll explain later.</p><p>It is not a charity exercise. ØMQ is a for-profit project, and a very profitable one. The profits are widely distributed among all those who invest in it. It's really that simple: take the time to become an expert in ØMQ, or build something useful on top of ØMQ, and you'll find your value as an individual, or team, or company increasing. iMatix enjoys the same benefits as everyone else in the community. It's win-win to everyone except our competitors, who find themselves facing a threat they can't beat and can't really escape. ØMQ dominates the future world of massively distributed software.</p><p>My firm doesn't just have the community's back--we also built the community. This was deliberate work; in the original ØMQ white paper from 2007, there were two projects. One was technical, how to make a better messaging system. The second was how to build a community that could take the software to through to dominant success. Software dies, but community survives.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch05s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch06s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Reliable Pub-Sub (Clone Pattern) </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> How to Make Really Large Architectures</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
