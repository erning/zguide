I'd like to think that everyone was compensated in some way for their contributions, and I believe that with ØMQ, contributing means gaining expertise in an extraordinarily valuable technology, which leads to improved professional options.</p><p>However, not all projects will be so lucky and if you work with or in open source, you should understand the risk of burnout that volunteers face. This applies to all pro bono communities. In this section, I'll explain what causes burnout, how to recognize it, how to prevent it, and (if it happens) how to try to treat it. Disclaimer: I'm not a psychiatrist and this article is based on my own experiences of working in pro bono contexts for the last 20 years, including free software projects, and NGOs such as the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ffii.org" target="_top">FFII</a>.</p><p>In a pro bono context, we're expected to work without direct or obvious economic incentive. That is, we sacrifice family life, professional advancement, free time, and health in order to accomplish some goal we have decided to accomplish. In any project, we need some kind of reward to make it worth continuing each day. In most pro bono projects the rewards are very indirect, superficially not economical at all. Mostly, we do things because people say, "Hey, great!" Karma is a powerful motivator.</p><p>However, we are economic beings, and sooner or later, if a project costs us a great deal and does not bring economic rewards of some kind (money, fame, a new job), we start to suffer. At a certain stage, it seems our subconscious simply gets disgusted and says, "Enough is enough!" and refuses to go any further. If we try to force ourselves, we can literally get sick.</p><p>This is what I call "burnout", though the term is also used for other kinds of exhaustion. Too much investment on a project with too little economic reward, for too long. We are great at manipulating ourselves and others, and this is often part of the process that leads to burnout. We tell ourselves that it's for a good cause and that the other guy is doing OK, so we should be able to as well.</p><p>When I got burned out on open source projects like Xitami, I remember clearly how I felt. I simply stopped working on it, refused to answer any more emails, and told people to forget about it. You can tell when someone's burned out. They go offline, and everyone starts saying, "He's acting strange... depressed, or tired..."</p><p>Diagnosis is simple. Has someone worked a lot on a project that was not paying back in any way? Did she make exceptional sacrifices? Did he lose or abandon his job or studies to do the project? If you're answering "yes", it's burnout.</p><p>There are three simple techniques I've developed over the years to reduce the risk of burnout in the teams I work with:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>No one is irreplaceable.</em></span> Working solo on a critical or popular project--the concentration of responsibility on one person who cannot set their own limits--is probably the main factor. It's a management truism: if someone in your organization is irreplaceable, get rid of him or her.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>We need day jobs to pay the bills.</em></span> This can be hard, but seems necessary. Getting money from somewhere else makes it much easier to sustain a sacrificial project.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Teach people about burnout.</em></span> This should be a basic course in colleges and universities, as pro bono work becomes a more common way for young people to experiment professionally.</p></li></ul></div><p>When someone is working alone on a critical project, you <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> they are going blow their fuses sooner or later. It's actually fairly predictable: something like 18-36 months depending on the individual and how much economic stress they face in their private lives. I've not seen anyone burn-out after half a year, nor last five years in a unrewarding project.</p><p>There is a simple cure for burnout that works in at least some cases: get paid decently for your work. However, this pretty much destroys the freedom of movement (across that infinite problem landscape) that the volunteer enjoys.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch06s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch06s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Designing for Innovation </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Patterns for Success</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
