But how do we define "interoperable"? To guarantee interoperability, we need a kind of contract, an agreement that lets different teams in different times and places write code that is guaranteed to work together. We call this a "protocol".</p><p>It's fun to experiment without specifications, but that's not a sensible basis for real applications. What happens if we want to write a worker in another language? Do we have to read code to see how things work? What if we want to change the protocol for some reason? Even a simple protocol will, if it's successful, evolve and become more complex.</p><p>Lack of contracts is a sure sign of a disposable application. So let's write a contract for this protocol. How do we do that?</p><p>There's a wiki at <a class="ulink" href="http://rfc.zeromq.org" target="_top">rfc.zeromq.org</a> that we made especially as a home for public ØMQ contracts.</p><p>To create a new specification, register on the wiki if needed, and follow the instructions. It's fairly straightforward, though writing technical texts is not everyone's cup of tea.</p><p>It took me about fifteen minutes to draft the new <a class="ulink" href="http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:6" target="_top">Pirate Pattern Protocol</a>. It's not a big specification, but it does capture enough to act as the basis for arguments ("your queue isn't PPP compatible; please fix it!").</p><p>Turning PPP into a real protocol would take more work:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>There should be a protocol version number in the READY command so that it's possible to distinguish between different versions of PPP.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Right now, READY and HEARTBEAT are not entirely distinct from requests and replies.
