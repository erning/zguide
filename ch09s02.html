Today, for what it's worth, this argument seems settled: the "liberal" policy that we adopted for <code class="literal">libzmq</code> in early 2012 broke our dependency on a single prime author, and opened the floor to dozens of new contributors. More profoundly, it allowed us to move to a gently organic evolutionary model that was very different from the older forced-march model.</p><p>The reason I was confident this would work was that our work on the Guide had, for a year or more, shown the way. True, the text is my own work, which is perhaps as it should be. Writing is not programming. When we write, we tell a story and one doesn't want different voices telling one tale; it feels strange.</p><p>For me the real long-term value of the book is the repository of examples: about 65,000 lines of code in 24 different languages. It's partly about making ØMQ accessible to more people. People already refer to the Python and PHP example repositories--two of the most complete--when they want to tell others how to learn ØMQ. But it's also about learning programming languages.</p><p>Here's a loop of code in Tcl:</p><pre class="programlisting">
while {1} {
    # Process all parts of the message
    zmq message message
    frontend recv_msg message
    set more [frontend getsockopt RCVMORE]
    backend send_msg message [expr {$more?"SNDMORE":""}]
    message close
    if {!$more} {
        break ; # Last message part
    }
}
</pre><p>And here's the same loop in Lua:</p><pre class="programlisting">
while true do
    --  Process all parts of the message
    local msg = frontend:recv()
    if (frontend:getopt(zmq.RCVMORE) == 1) then
        backend:send(msg, zmq.SNDMORE)
    else
        backend:send(msg, 0)
        break;      --  Last message part
    end
end
</pre><p>And this particular example (<code class="literal">rrbroker</code>) exists in in C#, C++, CL, Clojure, Erlang, F#, Go, Haskell, Haxe, Java, Lua, Node.js, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, Tcl, and of course C. This code base, all provided as open source under the MIT/X11 license, may form the basis for other books or projects.</p><p>But what this collection of translations says most profoundly is this: the language you choose is a detail, even a distraction. The power of ØMQ lies in the patterns it gives you and lets you build, and these transcend the comings and goings of languages. My goal as a software and social architect is to build structures that can last generations. There seems no point in aiming for mere decades.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch09.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch09.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch09s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 9. Postface </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Removing Friction</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
