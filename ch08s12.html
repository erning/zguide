As the cost of computing falls every year, such networks become more and more common, be it consumer electronics or virtual boxes in the cloud. In this chapter, we've pulled together many of the techniques from the book to build Zyre, a framework for proximity computing over a local network. Zyre isn't unique; there are and have been many attempts to open this area for applications: ZeroConf, SLP, SSDP, UPnP, DDS. But these all seem to end up too complex or otherwise too difficult for application developers to build on.</p><p>Zyre isn't finished. Like many of the projects in this book, it's an ice breaker for others. There are some major unfinished areas, which we may address in later editions of this book or versions of the software.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>High-level APIs: the message-based API that Zyre offers now is usable but still rather more complex than I'd like for average developers. If there's one target we absolutely cannot miss, it's raw <span class="emphasis"><em>simplicity</em></span>. This means we should build high-level APIs, in lots of languages, which hide all the messaging, and which come down to simple methods like start, join/leave group, get message, publish file, stop.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Security: how do we build a fully decentralized security system? We might be able to leverage public key infrastructure for some work, but that requires that nodes have their own Internet access, which isn't guaranteed. The answer is, as far as we can tell, to use any existing secure peer-to-peer link (TLS, BlueTooth, perhaps NFC) to exchange a session key and use a symmetric cipher. Symmetric ciphers have their advantages and disadvantages.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Nomadic content: how do I, as a user, manage my content across multiple devices? The Zyre + FileMQ combination might help, for local network use, but I'd like to be able to do this across the Internet as well. Are there cloud services I could use? Is there something I could make using ØMQ?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Federation: how do we scale a local-area distributed application across the globe? One plausible answer is federation, which means creating clusters of clusters. If 100 nodes can join together to create a local cluster, then perhaps 100 clusters can join together to create a wide-area cluster. The challenges are then quite similar: discovery, presence, and group messaging.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch08s11.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch08.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch09.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Example Zyre Application </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 9. Postface</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
