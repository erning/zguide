It's a rule: build your projects in public view, and tell people about them as you go so your marketing and community building starts on Day 1. I'll walk through what this involves. I explained in The ØMQ Community<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. The ØMQ Community">Chapter 6, <em>The ØMQ Community</em></a> about growing communities around projects. We need a few things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>A name</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A slogan</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A public github repository</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A README that links to the C4 process</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>License files</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An issue tracker</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Two maintainers</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A first bootstrap version</p></li></ul></div><p>The name and slogan first. The trademarks of the 21st century are domain names. So the first thing I do when spinning off a project is to look for a domain name that might work. Quite randomly, one of our old messaging projects was called "Zyre" and I have the domain name for it. The full name is a backronym: the ZeroMQ Realtime Exchange framework.</p><p>I'm somewhat shy about pushing new projects into the ØMQ community too aggressively, and normally would start a project in either my personal account or the iMatix organization. But we've learned that moving projects after they become popular is counterproductive. My predictions of a future filled with moving pieces are either valid or wrong. If this chapter is valid, we might as well launch this as a ØMQ project from the start. If it's wrong, we can delete the repository later or let it sink to the bottom of a long list of forgotten starts.</p><p>Start with the basics. The protocol (UDP and ØMQ/TCP) will be ZRE (ZeroMQ Realtime Exchange protocol) and the project will be Zyre. I need a second maintainer, so I invite my friend Dong Min (the Korean hacker behind JeroMQ, a pure-Java ØMQ stack) to join. He's been working on very similar ideas so is enthusiastic. We discuss this and we get the idea of building Zyre on top of JeroMQ, as well as on top of CZMQ and <code class="literal">libzmq</code>. This would make it a lot easier to run Zyre on Android. It would also give us two fully separate implementations from the start, which is always a good thing for a protocol.</p><p>So we take the FileMQ project I built in Advanced Architecture using ØMQ<a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Advanced Architecture using ØMQ">Chapter 7, <em>Advanced Architecture using ØMQ</em></a> as a template for a new GitHub project. The GNU autoconf tools are quite decent, but have a painful syntax. It's easiest to copy existing project files and modify them. The FileMQ project builds a library, has test tools, license files, man pages, and so on. It's not too large so it's a good starting point.</p><p>I put together a README to summarize the goals of the project and point to C4. The issue tracker is enabled by default on new GitHub projects, so once we've pushed the UDP ping code as a first version, we're ready to go. However, it's always good to recruit more maintainers, so I create an issue "Call for maintainers" that says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If you'd like to help click that lovely green "Merge Pull Request" button and get eternal good karma, add a comment confirming that you've read and understand the C4 process at http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22.</p></blockquote></div><p>Finally, I change the issue tracker labels. By default, GitHub offers the usual variety of issue types, but with C4 we don't use them. Instead, we need just two labels ("Urgent", in red, and "Ready", in black).</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch08s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch08.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch08s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Discovery </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Point-to-Point Messaging</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
